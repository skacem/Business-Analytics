Recommendation systems are designed to predict what users might like, particularly where there are a vast amount of options available. They may explicitly suggest these recommendations to the user, or they may operate in background, deciding what contents to display without giving the user the ability to choose. In any case, they are critical for many types of businesses, as they can expose you to content you otherwise wouldn't have found, or keep a user engaged longer than they otherwise would have been. 
Although building a simple recommendation system can be fairly straightforward, the real challenge is developing one that works and where the business gets clear business value from it.
