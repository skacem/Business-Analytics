# Business Analytics

## Motivation

This is one of the ongoing updated repo documenting my personal journey towards mastering data science topics related to business.   

Most business analytics blogs and online courses are tech and programming loaded. 20% of the time they tell you how to install Python and then anaconda and then the rest of the time about the basics of Python and Statistics. Business analytics is supposed to emphasize the word business. After all, when you analyze a business, you want to come up with actionable recommendations that will bring competitive advantage to your client. That is what business analysts are hired for.     

Feel free to join in and share your Ideas, projects, best practices and experiences here an I hope you will enjoy this journey with me.
