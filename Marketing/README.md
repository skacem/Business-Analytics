# Multi-Touch Attribution with Markov Chains

Multi-touch attribution is the process of assigning value to respective customer touch points that have occurred leading up to a conversion. In other words it is trying to answer one of the key questions in advertisement: how precisely my campaigns and actions contributed to the conversions? That value is measured in revenue credit percentage, the portion of total revenue that can be attributed to each respective marketing strategy along the way.

Attribution modeling describes various methods marketers use to properly break up and assign conversion credits to various different channels in case users take multiple website visits, via multiple channels, to arrive at the ultimate conversion behavior.

* A valid attribution model  must cover all channels your users might visit your website fom, or else your calculation will be inaccurate and mostly inflated. 
* Most advertising platforms, such Facebook and google, offers you various ways to analyze the attribution model for data WITHIN their platforms. This lack of cross-platform integration is primarily due to the data barrier between various advertising platforms.

The point in time when a potential customer interacts with a campaign is called a touchpoint, and a collection of touchpoints forms a buyer journey.

Marketers use the results of an attribution model to understand what touchpoints have the most influence on successful buyer journeys, so that they can make more informed decisions on how to optimise investment in future marketing resources.

Buyer journeys are rarely straightforward

With so many touchpoints to consider it is difficult to distinguish between the true high and low impact interactions, which can result in an inaccurate division of credit and a false representation of marketing performance.

This is why choosing the best attribution model for your business is so important.

## Attribution Models

All attribution models have their pros and cons, but one drawback the traditional models have in common is that they are rules based. The user has to decide up front how they want the credit for sales events to be divided between the touchpoints. Traditional models include:
* linear
* Time-decay
* Positional

Luckily there are more sophisticated data-driven approaches that are able to capture the intricacies of buyer journeys by modelling how touchpoints actually interact with buyers, and each other, to influence a desired sales outcome. A data-driven model provides marketers with deeper insight into the importance of campaigns and channels, driving better marketing accountability and efficiency.

### Single-Touch Attribution
For many businesses, single-touch attribution is the default mode of operations. Under this model, credit is given only to the first or last instance of contact before conversion.  
This model can work, but it can also leave your business open to some misleading information on ROI and revenue attribution

### Time-Decay Model

### Linear Model

### Position-Based Attribution

### Interaction-Based Attribution

Markov chains, in the context of channel attribution, gives us a framework to model user journeys and how each channel factors into the users traveling from one channel to another to eventually purchase (or not).
